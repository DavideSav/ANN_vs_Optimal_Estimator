# ANN vs Optimal Estimator
## Author
* **Davide Savini**

## Description

Comparing Artificial Neural Networks Feedâ€‘Forward and an Optimal Estimator on a Regression case. The dataset used consists of measurements of atmospheric humidity, temperature, and pressure.

## Objective

The goal is to compare how Artificial Neural Network Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) performs with respect Optimal Estimator for Brightness Temperature estimation.
